# BrowserQuest

BrowserQuest was a HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game experiment setup in 2012 by the Mozilla project. The project was not being maintained or updated, the website went down some of the dependencies disappeared. The javascript language changed and I wasn't able to find a running version or instructions that still worked anywhere. The goal of this repository fork is to have a stable version that works and can be deployed on a server via Ubuntu Bash Script, on a virtual machine with Vagrant, and on a Docker Container.
